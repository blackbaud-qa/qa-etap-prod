Feature: EDH Integration - On Demand Import and Mulitple Participation Entries on One Account

  # TODO: Update Fullhouse Database once EDH us unflagged

  Background:
    Given I log out of eTap
    Given I login into eTap for CP5

  Scenario: EDH Integration - Run On Demand Import and Multiple Participation Entry Behavior
    When I click Management on the main menu
    And I click on Integrations on the management menu
    And I click the Resume Integration link on the set up EDH integration modal
    And I click import now on the everydayhero integration tile
    Then I wait for the edh import to finish successfully
#    #TODO: Change Buddy's name if issue gets fixed
    And I verify that multiple EDH Participations for a single Hero were imported correctly
    And I verify that I can manually add an additional Participation to a Hero who is already participating in a Fundraiser
    And I successfully merge two accounts with multiple Participations for the same Fundraiser
